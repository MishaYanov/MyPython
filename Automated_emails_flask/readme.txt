To set up the automated emails follow the steps in the automated emails folder:
 (Add your Gmail and password in the fields and add people to the excel file (as for this version only one interest is allowed, as I didn't loop the interests).
  To access your Gmail you will need to lower the security of your Gmail. security-> allow low security applications.

  This program will send all the articles that have the interest word in the title( used https://newsapi.org/). 
  To have your own API key sign up on the site I provided and change the API key. )
      I left an Open Gmail account for reference.
  The project is now a part of simple flask app that sends the form info into the project above (it doesnt use pandas and excel file for reading information anymore).
  
  Next step is to upload to heroku.
