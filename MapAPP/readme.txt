by using the next site: https://volcano.oregonstate.edu/volcano_table and using a execl sheet I created dataframe using pandas
World.json is the polygons for the countries.
The map features 2 layers:
  A colorful polygon describing the population in every country by 4 colors: red orange yellow and green.
  Positions for all the volcanos, their name and the height of the volcano.
