  Find words in database ignoring if the word was written in majuscule/miniscule/capitlized or mix of the three.
  Checking solutions and finding cpitalized or acronyms even if written in a wrong form.
  Detect misspled words and suggest the closest word to it.
  Using data.json/SQL(in progress) as database.
